1 - bandExt.c tested.  blat directs alignment to new routines with -band flag.
    Main new routine is gfSeedExtInMem in ffSeedExtend.c
2 - Added new gfFindHitsInRegion to genoFind.c.  Calling this in refineFf
    when start of qSeq and tSeq not aligning to get single tiled >=11mer hits. 
3 - Adding tiled >=11mer hits in middle and end as well.
4 - Adding search for sliding 8-mer seeds and also perfect matches plus
    splice sites for small exons to find bits not aligning.
5 - Fixed crash bug from trying to ffMergeClose empty lists.
6 - Bumped sliding seed size to 11.  Implementing dynamic-programming
    splice finder that weighs both splice consensus and matches/mismatches
    in area.
7 - It successfully aligns all refSeq that map to 22 to 22.  It shows
    339 'perfect' alignments rather than 331 in old version.  It is
    still quite a bit (10x) slower than old way,  seemingly concentrated
    mostly on some specific sequences.
8 - A little faster from making gfFindInRegion actually filter out
    ones out of region.  Still slow though.  Up to 340 perfect.
9 - Up to 341 perfect.  Still a bug in the exact scanning thing.
10 - Up to 344 perfect.  Running in 25s vs. 36 for old version. (Fixed
     exact scanning problem with polyA tails).
11 - Tested on mrna.33 vs. human genome.  Fixed a couple of crash bugs
     that emerged in the splice site hard cleanup.  On this larger set
     it appears to be a bit slower than the older blat. Looks like down
     to 342 perfect on chr22 test set (but 329 in old version, looks
     like a change in pslPretty).
12 - Attempt to fill small double-gaps with global banded aligner.  Up
     to 346 perfect.  Put in a stringent gapless aligner right after initial 
     seeding.  Up to 347 perfect.  Run time 20s.
13 - Fixed bug where degenerate 11-mer seeds not filtered out of
     look for tiny exons phase.  Time slightly improved.  Alignments of
     NM_017424 improved (but not perfect because of sequencing error.)
     Clamped exact search size to intronMax (750k) as intended.  In
     case of looking for 12-15-mer it would exceed this before.  
     No longer adding splice sites to exact match.  This caused as
     many problems as it solves because the exon may include some
     bleed-over at the point where it is called.  Still 347
     perfect.  Run time 17s.
14 - Tested all ESTs against build31.  Fixed one crash bug that came
     up.   The EST time is 412 CPU hours vs. 282 for the unbanded.
     Longest job is 5.17 hours vs. 1.57.
15 - Reorganized code so that it there is not so much crossover between
     modules working with ffAlis.  Removed last use of fuzzyFind in 
     the -band case.  Put in search for tiny internal exact matches
     that requires less perfect matches.
16 - Changing supStitch so that it stops when getting less than minScore
     as well as after specified number of iterations.  Making ffSeedExtend
     initially call supStitch with 8 rather than 1 iteration.  This fixes
     a missed exon on a case in chr19 with a very tricky tandem repeat.
     Further bumped up supStitch call to 16, and allowing more extension,
     even including some overlap to help in another case Yontao found.
     Still perfect 347 matches on 22.   Run time 20s.
17 - Having it trim ends that look suspicious.  It looks now like 
     this new system works well for mRNAs, but it still is not optimal
     for ESTs.  This is released as blat.21
