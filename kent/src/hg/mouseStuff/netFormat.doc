Hello - I think I've created a file only those obsessed with comparative
genomics could like.  This is the classified net file.   Here's a short
sample from near the beginning of human chromosome 1.  If your
mailer word wraps it it will look even uglier than it is.  See below 
for an explanation of fields.

I *do* like it though.  I think from this it will be pretty easy to get
most of the statistics I want to report.   Perhaps we can put this
information in an easier to view format on the browser details
page eventually.

The first seven fields are fixed, then it goes to optional name/value pairs.
The fixed fields are:
1.  class.   Either 'fill' or 'gap'.  Fill represents a portion of a chain.
2.  start in target (reference) chromosome.
3.  size in target.
4.  name of chromosome in query (other) species.
5.  relative orientation between target and query.
6.  start in query
7.  size in query

The name/value pairs are

id - ID of associated chain (gapped alignment) if any.
score - Score of associated chain
ali   - Number of bases in alignments in chain.
qFar - For fill that is on the same chromosome as parent, how far fill is
       from position predicted by parent.   This let's you tell if a
       rearrangement is local or if a duplication is tandem.
qOver - Number of bases overlapping with parent gap on query side.
        Generally this will be near zero except for inverts. 
qDup - Number of bases in query region that are used twice or more in net.
       This lets you distinguish between a rearrangement and a duplication.
type - One of the following values:
   top - Chain is top-level, not a gap filler
   syn - Chain is on same chromosome and in same direction as parent
   inv - Chain is on same chromosome on opposite direction from parent
   nonSyn - Chain is on a different chromosome than parent
tN - the number of unsequenced bases (N's) in target side
qN - the number of unsequenced bases in query side
tR - the number of bases in RepeatMasker masked repeats on target.
qR - the number of bases in RepeatMasker masked repeats on query.
tNewR - bases in lineage specific repeats on target.
qNewR - bases in lineage specific repeats on query.
tOldR - bases in repeats predating split on target.
qOldR - bases in repeats predating split on query.
tTrf - bases in trf (Tandem Repeat Finder) repeats on target.
qTrf - bases in trf repeats on query.
