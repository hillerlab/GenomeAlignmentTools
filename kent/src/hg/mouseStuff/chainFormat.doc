The chain format describes a pairwise alignment which can allow
gaps in both sequences simultaniously.   It is deliberately
quite dense.  Here's a section of a file:

chain 4900 chrY 58368225 + 25985403 25985638 chr5 151006098 - 43257292 43257528 1

The chains start with a header line that starts with the word 'chain' and
end with a blank line.   The lines after the header contain the size of
the ungapped alignment,  the difference between the end of this
block and the beginning of the next block in the human side (dt),  and
the difference in the mouse side (dq).   The last line contains only
the ungapped alignment size of the last block.

The header line contains the chain score,  the human chromosome,
chromosome size, strand, and chain extents,  the mouse chromosome,
chromosome size, strand and chain extents, and the chain id number.
The extents are as zero-based half open intervals, meaning
the first 100 bases of a sequence are represented as 0 100, while 
the next 100 bases are represented as 100 200.  When the strand is
'-' the coordinates are in terms of the reverse-complemented sequence.
