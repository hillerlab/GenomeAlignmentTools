# cnpSebat2.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated cnpSebat2.c and cnpSebat2.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#CNP Data from the Sebat lab
CREATE TABLE cnpSebat2 (

    chromEnd int unsigned not null,	# End position in chrom
    name varchar(255) not null,		# Gain or Loss
