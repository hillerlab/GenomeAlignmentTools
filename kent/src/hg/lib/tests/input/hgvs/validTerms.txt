# A variant that is famously known as "MTHFR C677T" or "MTHFR 677C>T" -- but the 677 is incorrect (from an old sequence ~1995):
NM_005957.4:c.665C>T
# Same variant in LRG transcript, protein and genomic coords:
LRG_726t1:c.665C>T
LRG_726p1:p.Ala222Val
LRG_726:g.14783C>T

# These three are equivalent (although p. is less specific):
NM_003002.3:c.276C>A
NP_002993.1:p.Asp92Glu
NP_002993.1:p.D92E

# This is not HGVS but seems to be a commonly requested format and is easy to transform into the internal representation of HGVS:
ALK G1494E
