# geneTree.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated geneTree.c and geneTree.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#A tree that represents the phylogenetic relation between a gene and its orthologs.
CREATE TABLE geneTree (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Name of gene
    tree longblob not null,	# Newick format of phylogenetic tree
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(name)
