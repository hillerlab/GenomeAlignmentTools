# cogsxra.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated cogsxra.c and cogsxra.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Clusters of Orthologous Genes information
CREATE TABLE COGXra (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Name of COG
    info varchar(255) not null,	# COG info
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(name)
