# itemDetailsHtml.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated itemDetailsHtml.c and itemDetailsHtml.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#table that allows adding html to details page for various items
CREATE TABLE itemDetailsHtml (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Name of item
    html longblob not null,	# HTML fragment to include
              #Indices
    INDEX(name)
);
