# expRecord.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated expRecord.c and expRecord.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#minimal descriptive data for an experiment in the browser
