# bed6FloatVal.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated bed6FloatVal.c and bed6FloatVal.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#BED 6 (with 0-1000 score), but also with floating-point value.
