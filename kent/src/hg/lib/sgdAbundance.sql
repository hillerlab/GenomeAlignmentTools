# sgdAbundance.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated sgdAbundance.c and sgdAbundance.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Protein abundance data from http://yeastgfp.yeastgenome.org via SGD
