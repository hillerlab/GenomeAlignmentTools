# agpGap.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated agpGap.c and agpGap.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Gaps in golden path
CREATE TABLE agpGap (
    chrom varchar(255) not null,	# which chromosome
    chromStart int unsigned not null,	# start position in chromosome
    chromEnd int unsigned not null,	# end position in chromosome
