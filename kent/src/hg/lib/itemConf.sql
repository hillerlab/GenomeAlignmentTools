# itemConf.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated itemConf.c and itemConf.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Probability and false discovery rate (FDR) for an element in a track.
