# wgEncodeGencodeAnnotationRemark.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodeAnnotationRemark.c and wgEncodeGencodeAnnotationRemark.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Annotation remarks
CREATE TABLE wgEncodeGencodeAnnotationRemark (
    transcriptId varchar(255) not null,	# GENCODE transcript identifier
    remark longblob not null,	# Comment by annotator
              #Indices
    index(transcriptId)
