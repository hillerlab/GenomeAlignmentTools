# wgEncodeGencodeEntrezGene.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodeEntrezGene.c and wgEncodeGencodeEntrezGene.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#The NCBI Entrez gene id associated with GENCODE transcript annotation
CREATE TABLE wgEncodeGencodeEntrezGene (
    transcriptId varchar(255) not null,	# GENCODE transcript identifier
