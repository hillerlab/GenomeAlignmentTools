# wgEncodeGencodeGeneSource.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodeGeneSource.c and wgEncodeGencodeGeneSource.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#The source of Gencode gene annotation
CREATE TABLE wgEncodeGencodeGeneSource (
    geneId varchar(255) not null,	# GENCODE gene identifier
    source varchar(255) not null,	# Source of gene
              #Indices
    index(geneId)
