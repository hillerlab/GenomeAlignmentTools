# encodeRegionInfo.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated encodeRegionInfo.c and encodeRegionInfo.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Descriptive, assembly-independent information about ENCODE regions
CREATE TABLE encodeRegionInfo (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Name of region
    descr varchar(255) not null,	# Description (gene region, random pick, etc.)
