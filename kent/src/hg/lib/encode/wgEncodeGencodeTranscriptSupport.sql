# wgEncodeGencodeTranscriptSupport.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodeTranscriptSupport.c and wgEncodeGencodeTranscriptSupport.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#GENCODE transcript support from other datasets
