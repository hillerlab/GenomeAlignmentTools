# wgEncodeGencodeTag.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodeTag.c and wgEncodeGencodeTag.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Tags associated with GENCODE transcripts.
CREATE TABLE wgEncodeGencodeTag (
    transcriptId varchar(255) not null,	# GENCODE transcript identifier
    tag varchar(255) not null,	# symbolic tag
