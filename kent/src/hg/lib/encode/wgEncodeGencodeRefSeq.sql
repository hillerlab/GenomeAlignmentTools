# wgEncodeGencodeRefSeq.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodeRefSeq.c and wgEncodeGencodeRefSeq.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#GENCODE transcript to RefSeq mRNA or non-coding RNA and peptide accession mapping
CREATE TABLE wgEncodeGencodeRefSeq (
    transcriptId varchar(255) not null,	# GENCODE transcript identifier
    rnaAcc varchar(255) not null,	# RefSeq mRNA or non-coding RNA accession
    pepAcc varchar(255) not null,	# RefSeq peptide identifier for coding accession
