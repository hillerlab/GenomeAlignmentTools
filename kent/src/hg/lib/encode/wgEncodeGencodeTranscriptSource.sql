# wgEncodeGencodeTranscriptSource.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wgEncodeGencodeTranscriptSource.c and wgEncodeGencodeTranscriptSource.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#The source of Gencode transcript annotation
CREATE TABLE wgEncodeGencodeTranscriptSource (
    transcriptId varchar(255) not null,	# GENCODE transcript identifier
    source varchar(255) not null,	# Source of transcript
