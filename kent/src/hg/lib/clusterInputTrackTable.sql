# clusterInputTrackTable.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated clusterInputTrackTable.c and clusterInputTrackTable.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Some information on tracks used as input for a clustering track
