# chromInfo.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated chromInfo.c and chromInfo.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Chromosome names and sizes
CREATE TABLE chromInfo (
    chrom varchar(255) not null,	# Chromosome name
    size int unsigned not null,	# Chromosome size
    fileName varchar(255) null,	# Chromosome file (raw one byte per base)
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(chrom(31))
