# knownIsoforms.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated knownIsoforms.c and knownIsoforms.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Links together various transcripts of a gene into a cluster
