# cdsSpec.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated cdsSpec.c and cdsSpec.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#GenBank-style CDS specification, indexed by sequence id
CREATE TABLE cdsSpec (
    id varchar(255) not null,	# unique sequence id
    cds varchar(255) not null,	# CDS specification, in NCBI format.
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
