# clusterInputDnase.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated clusterInputDnase.c and clusterInputDnase.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Some information on tracks used as input for a clustering track
