# tableAccessControl.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated tableAccessControl.c and tableAccessControl.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#List of tables which may be displayed only on certain virtual hosts.
CREATE TABLE tableAccessControl (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Track/table name (may omit chr*_ if split).
    host varchar(255) not null,	# Virtual host name on which table may be displayed.
              #Indices
    INDEX(name(20))
);
