# snp125ExceptionDesc.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also

# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Brief descriptions and counts of the exception types checked in the corresponding SNP track and snp???Exceptions table.
CREATE TABLE snp125ExceptionDesc (

    count int unsigned not null,	# Number of occurrences of this exception.
    description varchar(255) not null	# Brief description of exception.
    # No index necessary -- this is a tiny table.
