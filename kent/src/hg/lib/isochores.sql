# isochores.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated isochores.c and isochores.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Describes the positions of isochores with a chromosome
CREATE TABLE isochores (
    chrom varchar(255) not null,	# Human chromosome number
    chromStart int unsigned not null,	# Start position in chromosome
    chromEnd int unsigned not null,	# End position in chromosome
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Name of isochore - AT-rich or GC-rich
    gcPpt int unsigned not null,	# GC content in parts per thousand
              #Indices
    INDEX(chrom(12),chromStart)
