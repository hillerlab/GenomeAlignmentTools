# gtexInfo.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated gtexInfo.c and gtexInfo.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#GTEx general information
CREATE TABLE gtexInfo (
    version varchar(255) not null,	# GTEX data release (e.g. V4, V6)
    releaseDate varchar(255) not null,	# Release date

    maxMedianScore double not null,	# Maximum score observed for a tissue median (use to scale display)
