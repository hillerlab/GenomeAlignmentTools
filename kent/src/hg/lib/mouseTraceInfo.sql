# traceInfo.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated traceInfo.c and traceInfo.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

# Handed-edited to set table name and indices.
# The indices are built useing a fixed number of characters of the column
# to keep the size of the table under 2 GB.

#subset of the sequencing trace ancillary information, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/TraceArchiveRFC.html
