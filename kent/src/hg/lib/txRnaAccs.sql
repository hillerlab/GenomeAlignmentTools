# txRnaAccs.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated txRnaAccs.c and txRnaAccs.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#A list of Genbank accessions associated with a transcript
