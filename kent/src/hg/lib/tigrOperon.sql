# tigrOperon.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated tigrOperon.c and tigrOperon.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Format for TIGR operon file
CREATE TABLE tigrOperon (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# operon name
    size int unsigned not null,	# size of operon
    genes longblob not null,	# gene names
    info longblob not null,	# information
              #Indices
