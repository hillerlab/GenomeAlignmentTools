# bedGraph.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated bedGraph.c and bedGraph.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#bed-like graphing data

    chromEnd int unsigned not null,	# End position in chromosome
