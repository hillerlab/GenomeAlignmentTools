# barChartData.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated barChartData.c and barChartData.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Measured value for a sample at a locus, used for barChart track details (boxplot)
CREATE TABLE barChartData (
    locus varchar(255) not null,	# Locus identifier (e.g. gene name)
    sample varchar(255) not null,	# Sample identifier (as in barChartSample table)
    value double not null,	# Measured value (e.g. expression level)
              #Indices
    INDEX(locus)
);
