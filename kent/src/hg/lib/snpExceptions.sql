# snpExceptions.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated snpExceptions.c and snpExceptions.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Set of queries to look for snps that appear problematic
CREATE TABLE snpExceptions (
    exceptionId int unsigned not null,	# unique ID for this exception
    query       varchar(255) not null,	# SQL string to retrieve bad records
    num         int unsigned not null,	# Count of SNPs that fail this condition
    description varchar(255) not null,	# Text string for readability
    resultPath  varchar(255) not null,	# path for results file
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(exceptionId)
