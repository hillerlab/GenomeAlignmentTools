# bed12wSeq.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated bed12wSeq.c and bed12wSeq.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Browser extensible data (12 fields) plus two sequences
