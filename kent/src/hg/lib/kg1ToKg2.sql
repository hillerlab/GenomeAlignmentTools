# kg1ToKg2.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated kg1ToKg2.c and kg1ToKg2.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Lists old genes and equivalent new genes if any, and reason for dropping if any.
CREATE TABLE kg1ToKg2 (
    oldId varchar(255) not null,	# Old gene ID
    oldChrom varchar(255) not null,	# Old chromosome 
    oldStart int not null,	# Old start position
    oldEnd int not null,	# Old end position
    newId varchar(255) not null,	# New gene ID, may be empty
    status varchar(255) not null,	# How new/old correspond. Exact and compatible are good. Overlap, none are bad.
