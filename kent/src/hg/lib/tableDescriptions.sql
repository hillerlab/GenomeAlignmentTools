# tableDescriptions.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated tableDescriptions.c and tableDescriptions.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Descriptive information about database tables from autoSql / gbdDescriptions
CREATE TABLE tableDescriptions (
    tableName varchar(255) not null,	# Name of table (with chr*_ replaced with chrN_)

    gbdAnchor varchar(255) not null,	# Anchor for table description in gbdDescriptions.html
