# scoredRef.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated scoredRef.c and scoredRef.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#A score, a range of positions in the genome and a extFile offset
CREATE TABLE scoredRef (
    chrom varchar(255) not null,	# Chromosome (this species)
    chromStart int unsigned not null,	# Start position in chromosome (forward strand)
    chromEnd int unsigned not null,	# End position in chromosome
    extFile int unsigned not null,	# Pointer to associated external file
    offset bigint not null,	# Offset in external file
    score float not null,	# Overall score
              #Indices
