# distance.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated distance.c and distance.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Abstract distance between two genes
CREATE TABLE distance (
    query varchar(255) not null,	# Query gene.  Indexed
    target varchar(255) not null,	# Target gene. Not indexed
    distance float not null,	# Distance between two, possibly in some expression space
              #Indices
