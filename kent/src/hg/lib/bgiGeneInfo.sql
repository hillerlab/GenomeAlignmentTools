# bgiGeneInfo.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated bgiGeneInfo.c and bgiGeneInfo.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Beijing Genomics Institute Genes track additional information
