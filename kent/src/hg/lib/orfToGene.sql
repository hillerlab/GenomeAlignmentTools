# orfToGene.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated orfToGene.c and orfToGene.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Links from WormBase ORF to WormBase gene classification
