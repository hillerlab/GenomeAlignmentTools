# chromGraph.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated chromGraph.c and chromGraph.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#A graph over a chromosome - best used for low resolution graphs
