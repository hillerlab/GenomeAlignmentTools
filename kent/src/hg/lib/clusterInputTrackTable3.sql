# clusterInputTrackTable3.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated clusterInputTrackTable3.c and clusterInputTrackTable3.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Some information on tracks used as input for a clustering track
