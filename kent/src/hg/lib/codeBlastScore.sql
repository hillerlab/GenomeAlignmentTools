# codeBlastScore.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated codeBlastScore.c and codeBlastScore.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Table storing the codes and positional info for blast runs.
