# growthCondition.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated growthCondition.c and growthCondition.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Conditions under which cells are grown
CREATE TABLE growthCondition (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Symbolic name of growth condition
    shortLabel varchar(255) not null,	# Short description of growth condition
    longLabel varchar(255) not null,	# Longer description of growth condition
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(name(32))
);
