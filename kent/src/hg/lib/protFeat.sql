# protFeat.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated protFeat.c and protFeat.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#A protein feature, like a domain or something.
CREATE TABLE protFeat (
    protein varchar(255) not null,	# Name of protein
    start int not null,	# Start of feature (zero based)
    end int not null,	# End of feature (non-inclusive)
    feature varchar(255) not null,	# Feature name
    score double not null,	# Some sort of score, often an eVal
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(protein)
);
