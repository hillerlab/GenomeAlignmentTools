# bed.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated bed.c and bed.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Browser extensible data
CREATE TABLE bed (
    chrom varchar(255) not null,	# Human chromosome or FPC contig
    chromStart int unsigned not null,	# Start position in chromosome
    chromEnd int unsigned not null,	# End position in chromosome
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Name of item
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(chrom)
);
