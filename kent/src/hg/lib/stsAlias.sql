# stsAlias.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated stsAlias.c and stsAlias.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#STS marker aliases and associated identification numbers
CREATE TABLE stsAlias (
    alias varchar(255) not null,	# STS marker name
    identNo int unsigned not null,	# Identification number of STS marker
    trueName varchar(255) not null,	# Official UCSC name for marker
              #Indices
    INDEX(alias(20)),
