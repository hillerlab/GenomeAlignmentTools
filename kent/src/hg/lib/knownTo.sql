# knownTo.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated knownTo.c and knownTo.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Map known gene to some other id
CREATE TABLE knownTo (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Same as name field in known gene
    value varchar(255) not null,	# Other id
              #Indices
    INDEX(name),
    INDEX(value)
);
