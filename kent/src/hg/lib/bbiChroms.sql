# bbiChroms.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also
# generated bbiChroms.c and bbiChroms.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly
# automatic way.

#bigData file names and corresponding chromosome names
CREATE TABLE bbiChroms (
    fileName varchar(255) not null,	# bigData (e.g. bigWig, BAM) file path with data for one chromosome
    seqName varchar(255) not null,	# Reference sequence chromosome or scaffold
              #Indices
