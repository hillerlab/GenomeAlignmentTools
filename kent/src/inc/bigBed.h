/* bigBed - interface to binary file with bed-style values (that is a bunch of
 * possibly overlapping regions.
 *
 * This shares a lot with the bigWig module. 
 *
 * Most of the functions here are concerned with reading bigBed files.  There's
 * two common things you want to do with a bigBed,  either stream through everything in it,
 * or just read the parts that overlap a interval within the genome.  The files
 * are optimized for interval queries, but streaming through them is not difficult either.
 * 
 * To query an interval:
 *    struct bbiFile *bbi = bigBedFileOpen(fileName);
 *    struct lm *lm = lmInit(0); // Memory pool to hold returned list
 *    struct bigBedInterval *list = bigBedIntervalQuery(bbi, chrom, start, end, 0, lm);
 *    struct bigBedInterval *el;
 *    for (el = list; el != NULL; el = el->next)
 *        // do something involving chrom, el->start, el->end
 *    lmCleanup(&lm);         // typically do this after each query
 *    bigBedFileClose(&bbi);  // typically only do this when finished all queries
 *
 * To stream through whole file
 *    struct bbiFile *bbi = bigBedFileOpen(fileName);
 *    struct bbiChromInfo *chrom, *chromList = bbiChromList(bbi);
 *    for (chrom = chromList; chrom != NULL; chrom = chrom->next)
 *        {
 *        struct lm *lm = lmInit(0);
 *        struct bigBedInterval *list = bigBedIntervalQuery(bbi,chrom->name,0,chrom->size,0,lm);
 *        struct bigBedInterval *el;
 *        for (el = list; el != NULL; el = el->next)
 *            // do something involving chrom, el->start, el->end
 *        lmCleanup(&lm);
 *        }
 *    bigBedFileClose(&bbi);
 *
 * The processes for streaming through or doing interval queries on a bigWig file are very 
 * similar. */
