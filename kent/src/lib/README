This directory contains general purpose, web oriented,
and computational biology oriented modules,  as well
as some less general stuff associated with the Intronerator
web site.  Initially this library was created by Jim
Kent from 1999 to 2001.  Since then other programmers have
also added to it.  Jim continues to make substantial
contributions.

With the exception of the gifcomp.c module, all 
modules here are free for all use - public, private,
or commercial. The gifcomp.c module contains code
originally distributed by CompuServe under a similar
"free for all" license and the Unisys LZW patent expired in 2003.
